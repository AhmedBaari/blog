## hanahaki
I dreamed of a love when I was young,

but now all I feel is the presence of flowers in my lungs.

I could cut it out and find the cure,

but what if I lose the feelings I have for you...

around you, my face gleams with love and devotion.

But around me, your face lacks emotions.

There are times when I secretly ask for help from the gods up above,

But deep down I know I am nothing but just a pawn to this game called,"love".

I always sit and say to myself,"maybe it wasn't meant to be."

and that is how this hanahaki takes over me....

to the one at the end of the other string, I hope 

you find someone who loves you as much as I do,

Thank you for letting me feel this emotion,but I can't help and just fall for you.
