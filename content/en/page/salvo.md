## About Me

I am a 1st year student who has had a lifelong interest in the field of computers since childhood. At SASTRA University, I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

I am aspiring to be a data scientist and currently learning Machine Learning, Aurdino (IoT), C and backend web development. 

I am renowned for my communication skills and believe that teamwork and healthy collaboration is the golden key to achieving success.


## The Machine Learning Field

### Mathematics

I do well in the area of **probability** and comprehending problems involving **Linear Equations in 3 Variables** as far as the Class 10, 11 and 12 portions of CBSE is concerned.

### Python

I am well aware of python at a basic level. I was recently introduced to pandas and numpy libraries, although more work is required to be done there. You can have a look at my python learning repository here:

### Machine Learning

I am aware about the basic theory of Machine Learning including it's classifications. I know about the types of supervised machine learning. But, I do not have hands on experience in any.

### Guidance

I am being guided by **Thavendran Sir** from The School Of Computing, SASTRA University to learn Machine Learning.
